# Cheering Mascot

## Summary

We're going to build a very simple web application using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/documentation.html), a lightweight framework for building web applications in Ruby.  We'll be exploring both how to pass data when making HTTP requests and also how to access data that's been passed with a request.  We'll take a look at both `GET` and `POST` requests.

### Mascot Module
This challenge is a web version of the Cheering Mascot Ruby command line challenge.  In case anyone is unfamiliar with that challenge or needs a refresher, here's an overview.

| CHEER NAME      | SIGN TEXT      |
| :-------------: | :------------: |
| RED HOT         | H-O-T!         |
| DO IT AGAIN     | Go, Fight, Win |
| 2 BITS          | Holler!        |
| STOMP YOUR FEET | STOMP!         |

  *Table 1*.  Cheers for which the mascot has signs.

We are leading some cheers, and we have a mascot helping us by holding up signs that correspond to our cheers.  The mascot only has signs for a handful of cheers.  The mascot will hold up the appropriate sign, if we shout the name of the cheer we want to hear (i.e., type with all caps).  But, if we call out a cheer for which the mascot has no sign or if we don't shout out the name of the cheer loud enough for the mascot to hear, the mascot holds up a generic "Go Team!" sign.

A `Mascot` module has been provided (see `app/models/mascot.rb`).  The purpose of the module is to determine the sign to hold based on the name of a given cheer.

### Sinatra Skeleton
The folder structure of this challenge has been designed to mimic the structure of a Rails application.  At DBC, the Sinatra challenges all share a similar skeleton, so it's worth taking a moment to orient ourselves to how it's organized.

Particularly noteworthy is the `app` directory.  Most of the files we'll be working with will be stored in its subfolders.

- `app/controllers` contains the files where we define how our application will respond to various HTTP requests.

- `app/helpers` contains the files where we define methods shared by our controllers and views.  We won't be defining any in this challenge.

- `app/models` contains the files where we define the classes and modules used in our application.

- `app/views` contains the files where we define templates that we'll convert to HTML and send back as responses to HTTP requests.


## Releases
### Pre-release: Running the App Locally
To begin, let's make sure that all required gems have been installed; run `bundle` to install any missing gems.  

To launch the web application this command from the application root directory:

```text
$ shotgun config.ru
```

Sinatra, like Rails, is a [Rack-based](http://rack.github.com/) framework, which means the main point of entry is this `config.ru` file.  The `ru` stands for "rackup."

Tip: No need to include the argument `config.ru` to `shotgun`. By default `shotgun` looks for a `config.ru` file.

You should now be able to visit your web app at [http://localhost:9393](http://localhost:9393).  `localhost` always refers to "the current machine," so you actually have a tiny web server running on your own computer!

It should look like this:

If it looks different call a staff member over!

### Release 1: Make Grandma Talk

First, visit [http://localhost:9393/?grandma=hey!](http://localhost:9393/?grandma=hey!).  Notice how the value of the URL parameter `grandma` is rendered on the page.  Try to find where in the code this logic exists.  How do we extract information from the URL parameters?

Note: When you enter a URL in your web browser, it makes an HTTP GET request. Notice how that matches the `get '/'` route defined in `app/controllers/index.rb`?

Try modifying the value of the `grandma` query parameter. What if you change the query parameter name to `grandpa`?

The string after a URL that looks like `?param1=value1&param2=value2` is called a **query string**, and it contains the parameters of the request.

Load up the web app, type something into the talk-to-Grandma box, and click "Say it!"  What happens and why?

### Release 2:  Make Grandma Logical

Finally, change `app/controllers/index.rb` so that after you send a message to Grandma via the form her reponse is displayed via the `app/views/index.erb` template. Take inspiration from the `get '/'` route.

If you typed in something in ALL CAPS make her respond humorously.  If you typed in something else make her response with "Speak up, kiddo!"

Read the [Sinatra documentation][] on [browser redirect][] and the [handlers section][] of the [Sinatra Book][].  You'll want to redirect back to `http://localhost:9292/?grandma=foobar` (where `foobar` is whatever Grandma has to say) after the user submits their form.

### Submit your code!

**Only your `index.rb` file should have changed.**  Create a pull request with your changes.
